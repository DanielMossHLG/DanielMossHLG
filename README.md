# Hi there! I'm Daniel Moss, but most folks just call me *Moss*

## I'm a game developer at <a href="https://hyperluminalgames.com/">Hyper Luminal Games</a>
I use C# and Unity to create games, but also have professional experience using JavaScript, PixiJS, Python, React, HTML/CSS and PostgreSQL.
I've dabbled a bit here and there with C++ and Unreal Engine.

  
## About me
  - Mathematical mindset; I studied maths and physics before my decision to change career paths
  - Desire to build fun experiences for users
  - I also work as a voice actor!
  - I'm probably gluten intolerant but I love pizza too much to come to terms with that fact
  - Sadly I cannot get over my League of Legends addiction...
